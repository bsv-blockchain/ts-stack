# Output knowledge implementation qualification

This branch implements the proposed [BRC-192–199 packet](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/pull/284).
The specification checkpoint is approved for implementation. The implementation
checkpoint remains open; neither an initial package version nor passing foundation
tests announces completion, publication or production qualification.

The core contracts remain application-neutral. Application examples demonstrate
the contracts without defining their semantics. Existing wallet, overlay, lookup,
submission and GASP behavior remains available to applications that do not opt in.

## Implemented foundation

- Additive SDK wire codecs, canonical encodings, digest domains, signed capability
  profiles, observation schemas and bounded BRC-193 request/response schemas,
  plus closed BRC-194 put/get/finalize endpoint codecs.
- Bounded common service errors, explicit capacity minimums and the specified
  BRC-193 HTTP status mapping, separate from local cancellation/storage failures.
- An additive AuthFetch automatic-payment opt-out for unpaid authenticated requests,
  preserved across authentication recovery without changing existing defaults.
- Reusable SDK capability retention/revalidation at the original selection time,
  independent of current authorization, operation deadlines and discovery changes.
- Bounded retained-contract BRC-193 client HTTP open/read/close, authenticated peer
  and signed selection checks, payment refusal, cancellation and fixed continuity
  validation. Cursor persistence remains the caller's separate atomic obligation.
  Actual signed local HTTP tests qualify the client component, not a durable feed.
- Memory, SQLite and IndexedDB receipt journals with atomic local replay material,
  exact U64 revisions, compare-and-swap and recovery after an uncertain append.
- Exact-target BEEF assembly, alternative cross-source evidence, actual SDK
  Script/SPV verification, historical readiness and deterministic spend selection.
- Whole-group acceptance, source membership order, generation replacement, context
  fences and projection publication independent of authorized wallet actions.
- Explicit source currentness policy, provider/epoch isolation, immutable first
  receipt lifetimes, durable timer-driven expiry and scoped remote invalidation.
- Bounded, durable equivocation quarantine with immutable original identities,
  source continuity invalidation, accepted reconciliation and snapshot recovery.
- Canonical assessment presentation in new version-3 journals with fixture-based
  offline replay and continuation compatibility for existing version-1/2 records.
- Explicit installed proposal policies, actual author signatures, canonical
  author-document payloads, exact successor and PRP1 finalization relations.
- Pure proposal lifecycle plans with whole-record CAS, exact admission jobs,
  terminal outcomes and serialized expiry/finalization.
- Separate bounded Memory/SQLite proposal journals, immutable service configuration,
  atomic private events/jobs/operation claims and recovery after actual process exit.
- Atomic bounded local context, compatible body-only replay, terminal receipt capacity
  reservations and a shared SQLite capacity seal across independent writers.
- Retained proposal contract binding to exact installed policy parameters/lifetimes,
  explicit per-contract policy enablement and indexed atomic record/context reads.
- Durable proposal service orchestration, current access checks before serialization,
  original publication/admission contract recovery and preflight receipt capacity.
- Optional owned verification-context retention in versioned proposal reservations,
  compatible legacy replay and original-context admission recovery after restart.
- Optional Mongo admission-history retention and exact scoped lookup, preserving
  default receipts and leaving older unbound provenance unresolved. This supplies
  history access; the concrete bounded Engine admission bridge remains required.
- Concrete SDK proposal evidence verification and signed PRP1/SQLite integration
  against pinned synthetic header ancestry, with ordinary admission kept separate.
- The default Bitcoin reducer/worker, including recovery of accepted decisions
  without network access and explicit sealing of the journal's non-final policy.
- All 32 approved reconciliation traces through the default worker and SQLite,
  with actual SDK verification, delayed proof completion and offline restart.
- Bounded wallet basket pages, finite provider-scoped lookup receipts and direct
  delivery with commit-before-acknowledgement. Optional adapters live under the
  separate `@bsv/output-knowledge/sources` entry.

## Remaining checkpoint-two work

- Finish proposal contract configuration evolution, compaction preserving terminal
  fences, concrete durable admission bridges and restart-aware expiry scheduling.
- Complete BRC-193 durable snapshot/replay/long-poll services, retention, client
  source adapters and consistent Overlay/Overlay Express storage hooks, using
  the bounded client transport now implemented.
- Bind BRC-101 capability selection to the authenticated transport and explicit
  non-final profiles while preserving finite legacy defaults.
- Exercise existing private off-chain values and lookup context, then implement
  acquisition, funding/recovery, STEAK/POTATOES readiness and secret release.
- Implement and qualify the exact BRC-197 Script template, lineage validation,
  purchase, split, merge, payout, unanimous recipient-change and retirement routes.
- Integrate BRC-198 LCH acquisition and playback without changing BRC-170 behavior.
- Implement BRC-199 root-host output eviction, all serving/replay/admission/GASP
  fences, restoration and multi-host consistency demonstrations.
- Complete a working reference application, actual-browser persistence/restart,
  multi-host demonstrations and an application consuming live lookup updates.
- Finish API guides, operator guidance, conformance, property/mutation evidence,
  mobile/browser/packed-consumer checks and all exact-head remote quality gates.

Downstream application migrations follow the second review checkpoint. No package
publication, deployment or merge is authorized by this implementation checklist.

## Validation evidence and limits

The SDK run passes 7,741 tests across 222 suites, including all proposal endpoint
variants and closed-envelope, canonical encoding and intrinsic-policy checks. The output-knowledge
run passes 328 tests across 27 suites, with more than 95% line and 90% branch
coverage. Boundary tests cover durable assessment invalidation, exact replay
checkpoints, immutable source/context identities, partial storage histories and
projection publication/error isolation. Proposal tests also cover exact completion capacity,
concurrent-writer limit sealing, immutable local context and malformed SQLite
metadata/encodings. A signed capability and pending job recover together after
SQLite restart and manifest expiry. Service tests include current-access revocation,
original-selector recovery, proof-equivalent retries, concurrent SQLite expiry, lost
write acknowledgements and receipt capacity checked before admission. The concrete
evidence adapter runs actual SDK Script/Merkle checks on a signed PRP1 transaction.
Journal append mutation testing kills all 26 generated mutations.
The bounded BRC-193 client adds 47 unit tests and nine actual local HTTP tests
using SDK BRC-103/104 and the existing Express authentication middleware. They
cover signed snapshot/live/close responses, wrong peers, no authentication
downgrade, signed selection mismatches, corrupted signed bodies, unpaid errors
and cancelled-poll recovery. The complete middleware suite passes 217 tests.
These fixtures intentionally do not claim durable provider or client-store
qualification; source integration and the required live application remain open.
The source tests include a held SQLite append, storage failure, finite pagination,
non-cancellable wallet I/O, independent fast/slow hosts and host-local refresh.
Observation identities remain immutable within their complete source epoch across
local refresh generations and SQLite restart.
Changed identities now retain the conflicting receipt in bounded quarantine,
publish a durable source continuity change, and recover through a new snapshot.
Offline restart reproduces the quarantine without additional verification; other
providers and already accepted Bitcoin facts remain unaffected.

Root health, lint, formatting and type checking pass. Packed-consumer resolution
and all three declared browser entries pass. Core browser byte limits remain unchanged;
the optional adapter entry is independently measured and enforced. IndexedDB unit
tests use fake-indexeddb, so actual-browser qualification is still required. The
journal-backed trace binding is documented alongside the unchanged approved
fixtures; selection-function tests remain an independent layer.

Installed-policy head `332cfd9f5` passed all 41 applicable
hosted checks; two infrastructure/dependent-test skips were accepted by merge-gate.
This includes CodeQL, zero new Sonar findings, external Codecov and the repository
coverage gate. Storage/context head `671d079ee` also passed every applicable
hosted check, including external patch coverage at 90.24%. Installed contract head
`e24e96bd2` passed all 41 applicable checks, with two expected scope skips. Subsequent
implementation increments require their own validation.

These are intermediate results. The PR remains draft until the entire
checkpoint and all required checks succeed on its exact final head. Remote CI,
CodeQL and Sonar evidence must be recorded in the PR before review.
