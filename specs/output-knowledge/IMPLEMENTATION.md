# Output knowledge implementation qualification

This branch implements the proposed [BRC-192–199 packet](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/pull/284).
The specification checkpoint is approved for implementation. The implementation
checkpoint remains open; neither an initial package version nor passing foundation
tests announces completion, publication or production qualification.

The core contracts remain application-neutral. Application examples demonstrate
the contracts without defining their semantics. Existing wallet, overlay, lookup,
submission and GASP behavior remains available to applications that do not opt in.

## Implemented foundation

- Additive SDK wire codecs, canonical encodings, digest domains, signed capability
  profiles, observation schemas and bounded BRC-193 request/response schemas,
  plus closed BRC-194 put/get/finalize endpoint codecs.
- Bounded common service errors, explicit capacity minimums and the specified
  BRC-193 HTTP status mapping, separate from local cancellation/storage failures.
- An additive AuthFetch automatic-payment opt-out for unpaid authenticated requests,
  preserved across authentication recovery without changing existing defaults.
- Reusable SDK capability retention/revalidation at the original selection time,
  independent of current authorization, operation deadlines and discovery changes.
- Bounded retained-contract BRC-193 client HTTP open/read/close, authenticated peer
  and signed selection checks, payment refusal, cancellation and fixed continuity
  validation. Cursor persistence remains the caller's separate atomic obligation.
  Actual signed local HTTP tests qualify the client component, not a durable feed.
- Memory, SQLite and IndexedDB receipt journals with atomic local replay material,
  exact U64 revisions, compare-and-swap and recovery after an uncertain append.
- Separate optional workflow control storage with immutable configuration, whole-state
  CAS, exact immediate-write recovery and Memory/SQLite/IndexedDB adapters. Recovery
  never silently initializes lost storage. These cells remain separate from atomic
  receipt/checkpoint commits in the core journal.
- Optional BRC-193 live source composing retained HTTP with durable capture and
  exact core receipt gates. Original opening identity, receipt time, whole groups
  and predecessor receipts survive restart. Separate generation, account and chain
  fences reject stale workers; fixed expiry and selected terminal service errors
  persist cursor-free continuity resets. The source never pays or opens a new
  generation automatically. Its separate browser entry preserves existing budgets.
- Optional BRC-193 provider composition with installed query rules, stable whole-change
  mapping, bounded physical request ownership, notification hints and cross-process
  polling. Snapshot and live continuation share one retained history boundary.
- SQLite provider indexes and sessions sharing an actual transaction: original Open,
  signed contract, first response, private cursor material, permanent original-request
  fence and history pin commit together. Explicit create/reopen, serving epochs,
  monotonic clocks, capacity, expiry, compaction and durable disclosure guards are
  separate from Bitcoin evidence acceptance.
- Opt-in Overlay Express lookup routes with BRC-103/104 authentication before strict
  JSON framing, signed capability/profile binding, explicit CORS, no-store responses,
  byte/work limits and disconnect cancellation. The lazy host integration and separate
  public entry preserve old root imports, routes and middleware defaults.
- Exact-target BEEF assembly, alternative cross-source evidence, actual SDK
  Script/SPV verification, historical readiness and deterministic spend selection.
- Whole-group acceptance, source membership order, generation replacement, context
  fences and projection publication independent of authorized wallet actions.
- Explicit source currentness policy, provider/epoch isolation, immutable first
  receipt lifetimes, durable timer-driven expiry and scoped remote invalidation.
- Bounded, durable equivocation quarantine with immutable original identities,
  source continuity invalidation, accepted reconciliation and snapshot recovery.
- Canonical assessment presentation in new version-3 journals with fixture-based
  offline replay and continuation compatibility for existing version-1/2 records.
- Explicit installed proposal policies, actual author signatures, canonical
  author-document payloads, exact successor and PRP1 finalization relations.
- Pure proposal lifecycle plans with whole-record CAS, exact admission jobs,
  terminal outcomes and serialized expiry/finalization.
- Separate bounded Memory/SQLite proposal journals, immutable service configuration,
  atomic private events/jobs/operation claims and recovery after actual process exit.
- Atomic bounded local context, compatible body-only replay, terminal receipt capacity
  reservations and a shared SQLite capacity seal across independent writers.
- Retained proposal contract binding to exact installed policy parameters/lifetimes,
  explicit per-contract policy enablement and indexed atomic record/context reads.
- Durable proposal service orchestration, current access checks before serialization,
  original publication/admission contract recovery and preflight receipt capacity.
- Optional owned verification-context retention in versioned proposal reservations,
  compatible legacy replay and original-context admission recovery after restart.
- Optional Mongo admission-history retention and exact scoped lookup, preserving
  default receipts and leaving older unbound provenance unresolved. This supplies
  history access; the concrete bounded Engine admission bridge remains required.
- Concrete SDK proposal evidence verification and signed PRP1/SQLite integration
  against pinned synthetic header ancestry, with ordinary admission kept separate.
- The default Bitcoin reducer/worker, including recovery of accepted decisions
  without network access and explicit sealing of the journal's non-final policy.
- All 32 approved reconciliation traces through the default worker and SQLite,
  with actual SDK verification, delayed proof completion and offline restart.
- Bounded wallet basket pages, finite provider-scoped lookup receipts and direct
  delivery with commit-before-acknowledgement. Optional adapters live under the
  separate `@bsv/output-knowledge/sources` entry.

## Remaining checkpoint-two work

- Finish proposal contract configuration evolution, compaction preserving terminal
  fences, concrete durable admission bridges and restart-aware expiry scheduling.
- Finish provider qualification and connect live lookup to actual admission/projection
  producers and the reference application. Generic index publication requires all
  relevant producers and privacy writers to honor its atomic mutation/guard contracts;
  the provider alone does not retrofit those guarantees into existing topic managers.
- Bind BRC-101 capability selection to the authenticated transport and explicit
  non-final profiles while preserving finite legacy defaults.
- Exercise existing private off-chain values and lookup context, then implement
  acquisition, funding/recovery, STEAK/POTATOES readiness and secret release.
- Implement and qualify the exact BRC-197 Script template, lineage validation,
  purchase, split, merge, payout, unanimous recipient-change and retirement routes.
- Integrate BRC-198 LCH acquisition and playback without changing BRC-170 behavior.
- Implement BRC-199 root-host output eviction, all serving/replay/admission/GASP
  fences, restoration and multi-host consistency demonstrations.
- Complete a working reference application, actual-browser persistence/restart,
  multi-host demonstrations and an application consuming live lookup updates.
- Finish API guides, operator guidance, conformance, property/mutation evidence,
  mobile/browser/packed-consumer checks and all exact-head remote quality gates.

Downstream application migrations follow the second review checkpoint. No package
publication, deployment or merge is authorized by this implementation checklist.

## Validation evidence and limits

The SDK foundation run passes 7,753 tests across 223 suites, including all proposal
endpoint variants and closed-envelope, canonical encoding and intrinsic-policy checks.
The provider increment's full output-knowledge run passes 836 tests across 54 suites,
with 97.46% line and 94.16% branch coverage. This includes the statement boundary,
independent retained-opening bindings and exact retained-byte quota cases;
final exact-head qualification remains required. Boundary tests cover durable assessment invalidation, exact replay
checkpoints, immutable source/context identities, partial storage histories and
projection publication/error isolation. Proposal tests also cover exact completion capacity,
concurrent-writer limit sealing, immutable local context and malformed SQLite
metadata/encodings. A signed capability and pending job recover together after
SQLite restart and manifest expiry. Service tests include current-access revocation,
original-selector recovery, proof-equivalent retries, concurrent SQLite expiry, lost
write acknowledgements and receipt capacity checked before admission. The concrete
evidence adapter runs actual SDK Script/Merkle checks on a signed PRP1 transaction.
The original journal-append target killed all 26 generated mutations. The expanded
receipt/workflow CAS target passes 93.87% over 212 mutations (197 killed, two
timeouts, thirteen surviving, zero uncovered/invalid) at the unchanged 90% gate.
The bounded BRC-193 client adds 53 unit tests and nine actual local HTTP tests
using SDK BRC-103/104 and the existing Express authentication middleware. They
cover signed snapshot/live/close responses, wrong peers, no authentication
downgrade, signed selection mismatches, corrupted signed bodies, unpaid errors
and cancelled-poll recovery. The complete middleware suite passes 217 tests.
These transport fixtures intentionally do not claim durable provider qualification.
The additional live source integration exercises actual loopback HTTP, SDK BEEF
verification and SQLite, including progressive pages and a missed live group
recovered after disconnect/reopen. Its 86 focused cases also cover five actual
process-exit stages, exact receipt substitution, reset persistence, physical
cancellation ownership, authenticated binding, timing and storage capacity.
The live-source mutation coverage is split into two independently gated campaigns
after the combined hosted job exceeded its 45-minute deadline. The original
operation/configuration/source-state target passes 90.27% over 586 mutations
(459 killed, 70 timeouts, 57 surviving); the framing/receipt/work-boundary target
passes 92.68% over 355 mutations (299 killed, 30 timeouts, 26 surviving). Both have
zero uncovered or invalid mutants and retain the unchanged 90% minimum. The same
six production files and complete focused test selection participate, with no
mutation/operator exclusions; governance tests enforce the exact union. Local
campaigns finished in 16m35s and 10m31s. These runs include the stronger latest-context
assertion and a 300-case property preserving original identity and receipt-gated
advancement. That published client increment has its own hosted evidence below.
The provider qualification and required live application remain open.
The new provider and actual authenticated HTTP adapter exercise SQLite snapshot/live
continuation with two clients, missed-change recovery, manifest rotation, immutable
original responses, current revocation, exact limits and cross-process writes.
Process tests terminate before and after opening commit, interrupt compaction, race
two independent writers and move the clock while another process holds the database
lock. These fixtures exercise membership/framing and provider recovery; they are not
claims of application-level Bitcoin spend acceptance or production deployment.

Eleven new mutation campaigns pass the unchanged 90% minimum with zero uncovered or
invalid mutants: codecs 94.44%, query mapping 96.43%, batch/wait composition 91.48%,
provider service/work 96.31%, session codec/disclosure 93.04%, index 91.38%, index
records 97.04%, session record/schema 93.42%, retained payloads 97.28%, session
response gates 92.54%, and HTTP transport 90.23%. Together these exercise 3,822
mutants. Independent cases cover authenticated headers, original request and
manifest bindings, exact retained-byte capacity, and the native statement boundary.
The complete session-record source is partitioned at the `saveOpening` responsibility
boundary to leave CI headroom. Both jobs keep every previous regression, the
300-case provider property and the 300-case SQLite record rollback/identity property.
The record/schema and payload runs finished in 27m41s and 26m40s. Governance checks
require a contiguous complete source union and identical test selection; no operator,
source or threshold is excluded. The complete Express suite passes 559
tests across 19 suites. Root lint/format and affected type checks pass. Exact packed
runtime and Express exports and clean consumers pass, including the legacy Express
root with registry SDK 2.8.9 in ESM/CJS and strict .mts/.cts TypeScript consumers.
The optional lookup feature requires SDK 2.9.0. Browser composition passes without
SQLite, and all nine public-interface documentation examples compile against 22 exact
tarballs. The [provider guide](../../docs/guides/durable-live-lookup.md) covers initialization,
recovery, privacy writers, mounting, retention and operational limits.

The source tests include a held SQLite append, storage failure, finite pagination,
non-cancellable wallet I/O, independent fast/slow hosts and host-local refresh.
Observation identities remain immutable within their complete source epoch across
local refresh generations and SQLite restart.

The expanded SDK authentication mutation target passes 86.57% over 752 mutants
(594 killed, 57 timeouts, 101 surviving, zero uncovered/invalid) at its unchanged
gate. Workflow control storage adds 49 cases across three adapters, including
multiple connections, lost acknowledgement, SQLite process exit, changed binding,
corrupt revisions, missing storage, aborted IndexedDB transactions and late opens
after timeout. A 300-run property checks concurrent CAS winners and stale retries.
IndexedDB unit cases use a test implementation. A separate exact-tarball Chrome
consumer exercises native IndexedDB, strict CSP, page/browser restart, captured
batch replay, receipt-before-cursor ordering, cross-tab CAS and missing recovery
stores. Its empty-batch fixture isolates client storage; it is not authenticated
service, mobile or full application qualification. Its optional browser entry is separately
measured and bounded; no existing entry budget is raised.
Changed identities now retain the conflicting receipt in bounded quarantine,
publish a durable source continuity change, and recover through a new snapshot.
Offline restart reproduces the quarantine without additional verification; other
providers and already accepted Bitcoin facts remain unaffected.

Sequential driver work is explicit: synchronous adapters preserve immediate ownership
and CAS checks while returning rejected Promises for failures, and dependent
journal/transaction operations are pulled one at a time. Eleven runtime tests check
Promise behavior, pull-driven backpressure, iterator closure and non-assimilation
of host values; four additional focused SDK tests
check certificate-wait ordering, original error identity and the exact deadline.
The checkpoint metadata parser now admits valid maximally escaped strings within
a separate 64 KiB bound, without changing wire response limits. Original captured
journal fixtures are unchanged. Certificate-wait fixtures observe rejected work
before assertions and bound unexpected waits. The complete SDK and runtime
mutation targets pass without uncovered or invalid results. Explicit asynchronous
iterators preserve dependent write order without scheduling transaction writes
concurrently. Node-only Mongo iteration uses bounded object-mode streams; browser
code retains a portable iterator contract. No analyzer suppression or gate is changed.
Published live-source head `74cc115d720e42c3d7364060bdb9b2a12dd76107` passes 76 hosted
checks with two expected skips, including CodeQL and the exact-head Sonar gate.
The provider increment is not part of that head and needs its own hosted qualification.

Root health, lint, formatting and type checking pass. Packed-consumer resolution
and all declared browser entries pass. Core browser byte limits remain unchanged;
the optional adapter entry is independently measured and enforced. IndexedDB unit
tests use fake-indexeddb; the separate Chrome consumer qualifies native storage
and recovery. Full provider, application and mobile qualification remain required. The
journal-backed trace binding is documented alongside the unchanged approved
fixtures; selection-function tests remain an independent layer.

Installed-policy head `332cfd9f5` passed all 41 applicable
hosted checks; two infrastructure/dependent-test skips were accepted by merge-gate.
This includes CodeQL, zero new Sonar findings, external Codecov and the repository
coverage gate. Storage/context head `671d079ee` also passed every applicable
hosted check, including external patch coverage at 90.24%. Installed contract head
`e24e96bd2` passed all 41 applicable checks, with two expected scope skips. Subsequent
implementation increments require their own validation.

These are intermediate results. The PR remains draft until the entire
checkpoint and all required checks succeed on its exact final head. Remote CI,
CodeQL and Sonar evidence must be recorded in the PR before review.
